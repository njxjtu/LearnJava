1. Core Java Fundamentals

Even for experienced roles, interviewers will probe your understanding of the language's core principles. Don't skip these basics.

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Be ready to explain the four pillars (Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Abstraction) with clear, real-world examples.
Sample Question: "Can you explain the difference between an abstract class and an interface? When would you use one over the other?"
     
Java Keywords & Concepts:
final (for variables, methods, and classes), finally, and finalize().
static keyword: What does it mean for a method or variable?
Access Modifiers: public, protected, private, and default.
Collections Framework: This is a very common topic.
Know the main interfaces: List, Set, Map.
Understand the key implementations: ArrayList vs. LinkedList, HashSet vs. TreeSet, and especially HashMap (be prepared to explain how it works internally, e.g., hashing, collision handling).
Sample Question: "When would you use an ArrayList versus a LinkedList? What are the performance trade-offs?"
Concurrency:
Understand the thread lifecycle.
Explain what synchronized and volatile do.
What is a deadlock and how can you prevent it?
Familiarity with the java.util.concurrent package, especially ExecutorService.
Java 8+ Features:
Streams API: Be able to use map, filter, collect, etc.
Lambda Expressions: How do they work? What is a functional interface?
Optional: How does it help prevent NullPointerException?
Sample Question: "Given a list of Employee objects, use the Streams API to find the average salary of all employees in the 'Engineering' department."
2. Spring / Spring Boot & Web Services
This is your core experience area, so expect deep-dive questions.

Spring Core Concepts:
Inversion of Control (IoC) / Dependency Injection (DI): Explain the concept and its benefits.
Annotations: Be very familiar with @Component, @Service, @Repository, @Controller/@RestController, and especially @Autowired.
Sample Question: "What is the difference between Component, Service, and Repository annotations in Spring?"
Spring Boot:
Auto-configuration: How does it work? How can you exclude a specific auto-configuration?
Starters: What is the purpose of starters like spring-boot-starter-web?
Configuration: How do you manage application properties (application.properties or application.yml)? What is the @Value annotation?
RESTful APIs:
What are the principles of REST? (Statelessness, Client-Server, etc.)
Explain the common HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH) and when to use them.
What are HTTP status codes? (e.g., 200, 201, 400, 404, 500).
Sample Question: "What is the difference between PUT and PATCH?"
Microservices Concepts:
What are the pros and cons of a microservices architecture compared to a monolith?
How do microservices communicate? (e.g., REST APIs, Message Queues like RabbitMQ/Kafka).
Concepts like Service Discovery (Eureka/Consul), API Gateway, and Circuit Breakers (Resilience4j/Hystrix).
Sample Question: "How would you handle a situation where one microservice in a chain of calls is down?"
3. PL/SQL and Database Concepts
Your database skills are a significant asset. Be ready to demonstrate them.

Advanced SQL:
Joins: Be able to explain and write queries for INNER, LEFT/RIGHT, and FULL OUTER joins.
Grouping and Aggregation: GROUP BY, HAVING, and aggregate functions (COUNT, SUM, AVG).
Indexes: What are they? Why are they important for performance? What are the trade-offs?
Sample Question: "Write a SQL query to find all employees who earn more than their managers."
PL/SQL:
Procedures vs. Functions: What's the difference?
Packages: Why are they useful? (Encapsulation, performance, organization).
Cursors: Explain implicit vs. explicit cursors and when to use them.
Exception Handling: How do you handle errors within a PL/SQL block?
Sample Question: "Describe a complex PL/SQL package you wrote. What problem did it solve?"
Database Design:
Normalization (at least up to 3NF).
Primary Keys, Foreign Keys, and Constraints.
4. Apereo CAS (Your Niche)
This is a unique skill that can make you stand out. Frame it as a strength.

Be prepared to explain what CAS is and its role in Single Sign-On (SSO).
Talk about your experience supporting it. Did you customize it? Integrate it with new applications? Troubleshoot complex authentication flows?
Sample Question: "Tell me about a challenging integration or support issue you faced with Apereo CAS and how you resolved it."
5. System Design
For an application developer, these questions test your ability to think about the big picture.

You might be asked to design a high-level system like a URL shortener, a simple e-commerce site, or a Twitter-like feed.
Focus on:
Identifying the core components (web servers, application servers, databases, caches).
Defining the API endpoints.
Thinking about the data model (database schema).
Discussing trade-offs (e.g., SQL vs. NoSQL, when to use a cache).
Considering scalability and potential bottlenecks.
6. Behavioral Questions
These are just as important as technical questions. They want to know how you work. Use the STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result) to structure your answers.

"Tell me about a time you had a disagreement with a team member. How did you resolve it?"
"Describe the most challenging technical problem you've solved."
"How do you stay up-to-date with new technologies?"
"Walk me through a project you are particularly proud of from your resume."
Final Tips for Preparation
Know Your Resume: Be able to talk in-depth about every project and technology listed on your resume. This is the most common starting point for interviews.
Practice Coding: Use platforms like LeetCode or HackerRank. Focus on easy and medium-level problems related to arrays, strings, hashmaps, and linked lists. The goal isn't just to get the right answer, but to communicate your thought process clearly.
Prepare Questions for Them: Always have thoughtful questions ready to ask the interviewer about the team, the technology stack, the challenges they face, and the company culture. It shows you're engaged and genuinely interested.
